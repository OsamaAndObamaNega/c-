In C++, primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks of variables. Here's a table summarizing the sizes (in bytes) and characteristics of each primitive data type, along with its typical range on most common platforms (assuming a 32-bit or 64-bit system):

| **Data Type** | **Size**        | **Range**                                                                                   | **Characteristics**                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`bool`**    | 1 byte          | `true` or `false`                                                                           | Represents boolean values.                                             |
| **`char`**    | 1 byte          | `-128` to `127` (signed) or `0` to `255` (unsigned)                                         | Stores a single character or small integer.                           |
| **`wchar_t`** | 2 or 4 bytes    | Implementation-defined (depends on platform)                                                | Wide character type, used for Unicode characters.                     |
| **`char8_t`** | 1 byte          | Represents UTF-8 code units.                                                               | Introduced in C++20 for working with UTF-8 strings.                   |
| **`short`**   | 2 bytes         | `-32,768` to `32,767` (signed) or `0` to `65,535` (unsigned)                               | Stores small integers.                                                |
| **`int`**     | 4 bytes         | `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647` (signed) or `0` to `4,294,967,295` (unsigned)          | Stores standard integers.                                             |
| **`long`**    | 4 or 8 bytes    | `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647` (4 bytes) or larger ranges on 64-bit systems.          | Longer integer type.                                                  |
| **`long long`** | 8 bytes       | `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808` to `9,223,372,036,854,775,807` (signed)                       | Stores very large integers.                                           |
| **`float`**   | 4 bytes         | Approx. `1.2e-38` to `3.4e+38` with 6-7 decimal places                                     | Single-precision floating-point number.                               |
| **`double`**  | 8 bytes         | Approx. `2.3e-308` to `1.7e+308` with 15-16 decimal places                                 | Double-precision floating-point number.                               |
| **`long double`** | 8, 10, or 16 bytes | Platform-dependent; higher precision than `double`.                                      | Extended precision floating-point number.                             |
| **`void`**    | No size         | Represents absence of type.                                                                | Used for functions with no return value.                              |

### Notes:
1. **Signed vs. Unsigned:** 
   - Signed types can hold both positive and negative numbers.
   - Unsigned types can only hold positive numbers but have a larger range.
   - You can explicitly specify `unsigned` or `signed` for integer types.

2. **Size Variations:** 
   - Sizes of `long`, `wchar_t`, and `long double` can vary depending on the compiler and platform.
   - Typically, sizes are consistent on modern 64-bit systems, but it's good practice to use `sizeof` to check exact sizes for your system.

3. **Floating-Point Representation:** 
   - Floating-point numbers (`float`, `double`, `long double`) are stored in IEEE 754 format, with a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa.

4. **Platform and Compiler Dependence:** 
   - The size of some types like `int`, `long`, and `long double` can vary between platforms and compilers.
